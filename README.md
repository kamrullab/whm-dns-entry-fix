![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99b7acad-5a44-4813-93c5-5113a6a8e79b)


## ❌ **Error Message**  
📌 `(XID 4g3ue3) A DNS entry for “kamrul.us” already exists. You must remove this DNS entry from this server or all servers in the DNS cluster to proceed.`  

This error occurs because **WHM detects an existing DNS record** for the domain **kamrul.us** on the server or DNS cluster. To resolve this, you must **manually remove the old DNS entry** before proceeding with account creation or modifications.

---

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Solution**  

### 🔎 **Step 1: Locate the Existing DNS Entry**  
Run the following command to search for the DNS entry of **kamrul.us** on the server:  
```bash
grep -Ri "kamrul.us" /etc/named.conf /var/named/
```
👉 **This command checks if the domain already exists** in the DNS configuration files. If there’s output, that means the domain has an existing DNS record.

---

### 📜 **Step 2: Confirm DNS Zone in named.conf**  
To verify if the domain **kamrul.us** is listed in the **named.conf** file, execute:  
```bash
grep -i kamrul.us /etc/named.conf
```
📌 **If an entry appears, you must remove it before proceeding.**  

---

### 🗑 **Step 3: Delete the DNS Zone from named.conf**  
Run this command to **remove the DNS configuration for kamrul.us**:  
```bash
sed -i '/zone "kamrul.us" {/,/};/d' /etc/named.conf
```
✅ **This automatically removes the DNS zone entry** for the domain.

---

### ⚠ **Recommended:**  
In most cases, the above **three commands** are enough to remove the DNS conflict and resolve the issue. If the problem persists, follow the additional steps below.

---

### 🗂 **Step 4: Remove the DNS Zone File** (If Required)  
Delete the **kamrul.us.db** file from the system:  
```bash
rm -f /var/named/kamrul.us.db
```
⚠ **Warning:** This permanently deletes the **DNS zone file** for **kamrul.us**. Make sure you are targeting the correct domain.

---

### 🔄 **Step 5: Restart the DNS Service** (If Required)  
After removing the DNS entry, restart the DNS service to apply the changes:  
```bash
systemctl restart named
```
or  
```bash
service named restart
```
🚀 **This ensures that WHM reloads the updated DNS configuration.**

---

### 🔍 **Step 6: Confirm the Removal**  
To check if the domain **kamrul.us** has been **successfully removed**, run:  
```bash
grep -i kamrul.us /etc/named.conf
```
📌 **If there’s no output, the removal was successful! 🎉**

---

## 🔄 **Step 7: Recreate the Domain (If Needed)**  
If you need to **add the domain back**, follow these steps in **WHM**:  
1. Log in to **WHM**  
2. Navigate to **DNS Functions → Add a DNS Zone**  
3. Enter the domain **kamrul.us** and the correct nameservers  
4. Click **Create**  
   
✔ **Now, the domain should be properly configured without conflicts.**

---

## ⚡ **Final Notes**
✔ **Delete only the required DNS entry** to prevent affecting other domains.  
✔ If your server is part of a **DNS cluster**, make sure to check for the domain on other linked servers.  
✔ If the error persists, try **syncing DNS zones in WHM** using:  
```bash
whmapi1 listzones
```
✔ If using **WHMCS**, run a sync to update DNS records:  
```bash
/opt/whmcs/crons/cron.php do --SyncServer
```

By following these **precise and effective steps**, you can **resolve the Module Command Error** and **prevent DNS conflicts in WHM/WHMCS**. 🚀🎯
